This project was created as a University project, called PAE "Advanced Engineering Project".

The basements were to create a Telegram Bot which was able to have a conversation with the users and which would help taking care of the elders aiding them with their medications. 

## FUNCTIONS:

The Bot has plenty of functions which were used to help the users with their medications:
  - There is the possibility of introducing a ned medication or a prescription to the database, which is also handled in the project.
  - There is also the possibility to schedule some reminders for the user, which will be notified using Telegram to them. This notification allows to be responded in order to create some feedback and update having taken or not the medication.
  - Some history, inventory and curent treatments are also possible to be visualized using the Bot.
  - There is also the possibility to view all medications someone has to take using Calendar function, with inline handler calendar.
  
  ## AIMS
  The aim of the project was to make a Telegram Bot approachable for all ages. Therefore, we tried to make it as simple and elegant as possible. 
  Muliple functions can be executed just by single buttons pressings and making everything as visual as possible. Moreover, there is also the possibility to introduce inputs to the user by voice (recognizing some commands in different languages) or by image (with some computer vision algorithms we can detect Spaingh Medicines using CIMAs database).
  
  All Bot has the possibility to be reproduced in differnet languages and its handling is easy and flexible.
  
  ## DATABASE
